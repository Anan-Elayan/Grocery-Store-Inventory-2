## **Grocery Store Inventory**

# Objective
The objective of the "Grocery Store Inventory" project is to develop an inventory management system for a local supermarket using JavaFX framework.
The project aims to apply the concept of Event-Driven Programming while creating a user-friendly interface for inventory tracking.

# Project Description
As a new employee at the local supermarket, your task is to develop an inventory program to assist with inventory tracking.
The program serves as a prototype for future grocery software solutions. In the first phase of the project, basic functionalities were implemented.
Now, in the second phase, the goal is to enhance the software by adding rich JavaFX components. 
The main focus is on creating a user-friendly interface with features such as adding, modifying, deleting items, and generating stock reports.
All functionalities from the first phase will remain intact, but the user interface will replace the console output.
